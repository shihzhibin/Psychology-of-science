# __Introduction__
This repository is a tutorial for the implementation of __Individual and Nomothetic Models of Job Stress: An Examination of Work Hours, Cohesion, and Well-Being__ based on the design of the paper _"Individual and Nomothetic Models of Job Stress: An Examination of Work Hours, Cohesion, and Well-Being"_  by [Bliese, P. D., & Halverson, R. R. (1996)]("[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925527313001837?via%3Dihub](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1996-05414-004)"). I wrote this tutorial as a showcase of application for the psychology workshop.

## __Individual Level Perspectives of Job Stress__
> The study of job stress is dominated by models that emphasize individual perceptions as key components in the link between the environment and outcomes.

> __(1)Frequently cited job stress theories such as cybernetic theory (Cummings & Cooper, 1979; Edwards, 1992)__
> 
> __(2)Person-environment fit theory(French,Caplan,&Harrison,1982)__
> 
> __(3)Transactional model(Lazarus&Folkman,1984)__
> 
> __(4)Facet model (Beehr & Newman, 1978)__ 


> Share `one key` similarity: They are based on the assumption that `individual differences in personal variables` such as `personality characteristics` ,`abilities`, `beliefsv, and goals play crucial roles in determining how individuals perceive and respond to their environments. 

## __Nomothetic Perspectives of Job Stress__
> In job stress research, one may also examine consistencies in how groups of individuals appraise and react to their environments.

> Support for the nomothetic perspective of job stress research rests on establishing `two conditions`

>First, it is important to demonstrate that group members agree about assessments of their work environments (i.e., their work climates), since establishing within-group agreement is crucial to the argument that climates exist (James, 1982; Klein, Dansereau, & Hall, 1994).

>Second, it is important to demonstrate that there are differences in work climates across groupsandthatthesedifferencesarerelatedtogroupoutcomessuchaswell-being.

>In the current study, we contrast individual and nomothetic perspectives of job stress by examining the linkages between several components of the work environment and psychological well-being. Specifically, we conducted a mul- tilevel examination of the relationships among `(a) work hours`, `(b) vertical cohesion`, `(c) horizontal cohesion`, and `(d) the dependent variable, psychological well-being`. On theoretical grounds, these variables can be conceptualized from either the individual or nomothetic perspectives. We begin by discussing psychological well-being.

>We believe that the two perspectives test different aspects of the relationship between work hours and well-being. The nomothetic perspective examines whether the average well-being in a group is a function of the groups’ work load climate. The individual-level perspective examines whether an individual’s well-being is a function of the hours he or she reports working.
